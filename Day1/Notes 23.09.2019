Assigning single value to multiple variables
x=y=z=50

print(type(x)) -> Class 'int'

type():--> this method returns the data type

For integer string and float if the values are same then the variables are pointing to same memory location

As x,y,z's value are same so print(id(x)), print(id(y)), print(id(z)) are same. IE. memory address of all three variables are 
same.

id():--> this method returns the memory address
